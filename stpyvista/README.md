### Show PyVista visualizations in Streamlit

This component takes a PyVista plotter object and shows it on Streamlit as an interactive element (as in it can be zoomed in/out, moved and rotated, but the visualization state is not returned). It uses [Panel](https://panel.holoviz.org/reference/panes/VTK.html#working-with-pyvista) to render PyVista plotter objects within an iframe.
